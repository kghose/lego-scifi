After struggling a bit with iteration 5, I'm going back to an earlier idea of
keeping the core 10497 cabin. The 10497 cabin is nicely designed and makes
efficient use of the two canopies and the blue bricks for walls. 

In this idea the cabin is enlarged (either making it taller or wider), the wings
are removed and a petal type airlock is added just after the main cabin, and
before the engine pack at the end.

The conical form ([Iteration 5](iteration5.io) and family) has the following drawbacks:

1. The shape looks a bit bulky/blocky, which may be how deep spacecraft might
   actually look, but looks boring from a play perspective. 
2. I have to do a lot of fiddling to close the space between the canopy and the
   nose.
3. The petal structure is an "ease of play" feature, rather than an actual play
   feature. By this, I mean that the petals open up in the same way a doll house
   wall or roof lifts off - so we can access the interior space, rather than
   because it's actual play feature.

I think there would be a good payoff in trying to get iteration5 to work. The
shape is innovative, and for the given pieces in 10497 this ship has a good
interior play volume.

We could get over (1) by greebling the surface and adding fins. (2) is harder
but could be done at the expense of a bunch of plates, though we have to harden
the canopy hinge, which has a tendency to peel off. Ideally, for (3) we would
have a play feature that involves the petals, but it's not that critical.

## Main A frame
By making the black studless beams asymmetric
(not in the center and offset oppositely) we
make the nose stable. (Nose would rock, otherwise).

## Canopy attachment
We have to have the canopy a little "high" other wise it
interferes with the adjacent wedge plates and can't be opened.

## Wedge plates 
The single hinge design (473ff38) might not be sturdy enough
for play. 
1. Look into if we have enough hinges for a 2 hinge
per panel design.
2. Use the 10497 angle technique to secure the 45deg plate

Ideally we'd like to be able to latch the wedge plates so 
they don't swing out during play, but can be opened.
