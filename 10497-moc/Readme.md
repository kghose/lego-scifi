One possible configuration. I can't fit a slider airlock in this space now, and
will try a conventional swing out airlock door. I've rotated the engine pack
back into the "plane" of the main cabin.


## 2022.09.17

6.1 looks more elegant to me than 6.2. At first I thought it was because the
engine pack wasn't built in 6.2, but then I realized the base of 6.2 is deeper
(there is more past the "arrowhead".)

The cabin space I gained by adding the two layers of bricks is not so playable.
I want to try removing it and seeing if the ship looks more elegant that way.
The trick will be to fit the airlock door slder in that space.

## 2022.09.15

Worked on the airlock door area. It's coming along decently. I think when I
enlarge the engine section, teh ship won't look so lop-sided, even if the engine
"plane" is perpendicular to the main cabin.

In this orientation, it looks a bit like a fish, which I don't like, but perhaps
with proper greebling it will look better. I want to get back to the engine pack
from 2022.09.11 and maybe even rotate it back into plane with the main cabin.
Let's see.

1. Vastly improved frame, predicted to be much more rigid and strong.
1. Went back to the single beam tail. Tail is still rotated 90 degrees w.r.t
   main cabin.
1. The airlock is greatly reduced in size in anticipation of making the cabin
   detachable. 
1. Changed how the tail attaches to the beam.
1. Need to add in the new engine design.

Finally! I think I've got a decent way to mount the canopies and reinforce the
diamond structure. I think I have the airlock the way I want it. 

![Stingray](iteration6-2022.09.11.jpg)

The technic beam has holes that can look ugly to some, and with some more work,
I could lay plates over it to cover it up, but I am happy with how it is now.

This [snot] page came in useful for the 90 degree geometry, and this one for [45
degree geometry][fortyfive].

## 2022.09.08

I want to call [it](iteration6.1.io) "The Stingray".

![Stingray](iteration6-2022.09.09.jpg)

I've dropped all the earlier fancy building approaches in favor of a simpler,
more robust studs up construction that still lets me create these nice angles
and use the available plates to create a large living space. This one _feels_
smaller than the earlier Iteration 6, but I can't figure out why. The "floor" of
the cabin (above the airlock) isn't done in the new one, and that could be the
reason why.


## 2022.09.08

It won't be everyone's cup of tea, but I'm really excited by Iteration 6
(which has now morphed to a Diamond form). The petal airlock will go between the
main cabin and the engine pod. 

This uses most of the panels to give a large habitable space. Most of the bricks
are used to create the bottom of the cabin (right above/next to the airlock),
and some will be needed for the frame of the canopy.

The iconic brick built arrow gives us lineage from the official 10497 and gives
us some wall for fewer bricks.

The sloping canopy + frame pays homage to the 10497's sloping cabin AND sets the
tone for our diamond motif AND doubles down on slopes by having two oppositely
sloping canopies.

## 2022.09.06

I went back and took a second look at iteration 6 (Triangle form, where the two
canopies touch at the tips, their edges forming sides of a triangle.) After
fiddling a bit, and thinking about the design as I went to sleep, I think I have
an interesting, playable model with a petal airlock and nice lines and good use
of the plates to give us a large interior space.

The top of it will be two slanted surfaces that take the basic idea from the
10497's slanted cabin, but do this twice, forming the triangle described.


## 2022.09.05

After struggling a bit with iteration 5, I'm going back to an earlier idea of
keeping the core 10497 cabin. The 10497 cabin is nicely designed and makes
efficient use of the two canopies and the blue bricks for walls. 

In this idea the cabin is enlarged (either making it taller or wider), the wings
are removed and a petal type airlock is added just after the main cabin, and
before the engine pack at the end.

![Conical form](iteration5-2022.09.05.jpg)

The conical form ([Iteration 5](iteration5.io) and family) has the following drawbacks:

1. The shape looks a bit bulky/blocky, which may be how deep spacecraft might
   actually look, but looks boring from a play perspective. 
2. I have to do a lot of fiddling to close the space between the canopy and the
   nose.
3. The petal structure is an "ease of play" feature, rather than an actual play
   feature. By this, I mean that the petals open up in the same way a doll house
   wall or roof lifts off - so we can access the interior space, rather than
   because it's actual play feature.

I think there would be a good payoff in trying to get iteration5 to work. The
shape is innovative, and for the given pieces in 10497 this ship has a good
interior play volume.

We could get over (1) by greebling the surface and adding fins. (2) is harder
but could be done at the expense of a bunch of plates, though we have to harden
the canopy hinge, which has a tendency to peel off. Ideally, for (3) we would
have a play feature that involves the petals, but it's not that critical.


# Build notes

## Main A frame
By making the black studless beams asymmetric
(not in the center and offset oppositely) we
make the nose stable. (Nose would rock, otherwise).

## Canopy attachment
We have to have the canopy a little "high" other wise it
interferes with the adjacent wedge plates and can't be opened.

## Wedge plates 
The single hinge design (473ff38) might not be sturdy enough
for play. 
1. Look into if we have enough hinges for a 2 hinge
per panel design.
2. Use the 10497 angle technique to secure the 45deg plate

Ideally we'd like to be able to latch the wedge plates so 
they don't swing out during play, but can be opened.
