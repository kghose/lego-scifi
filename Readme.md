# Asteroid Hopper


## Look Ma! No wings

Wings? Where we're going we don't need -- wings.
There is no lifting body, because there is no atmosphere on the bodies we will
visit and we aren't about to terminate our lovely deep space trip by diving down
in a one way trip down some thick soupy atmosphere.

## Why do we have an umbrella?

That's our radiator system. Without it all the heat that our reactor,
instruments and our own bodies continuously generate can't escape our ship. Our
ship will melt from its own heat. The vacuum of space makes us a thermos bottle
that is continuously heating itself. The only way to cool off is to radiate
out in the infrared with those giant radiator fins.

### Why does it have those stripes?

Forty years ago, someone at LEGO decided those would be cool colors to put on a
spaceship. 

## Which way is up?

There is no UP, since we are in a zero/micro-gravity environment. At best, if we
decide to touch a rather large asteroid, a faint tug of gravity will give us a
faint sensation of up and down. 

This model can be played with in any orientation, just as the astronauts in deep
space will float around their ship in any orientation.
