# Asteroid Hopper

Model and images (c) Kaushik Ghose 2022

Affectionately known as Ol' Hammerhead, this deep space exploration vessel has
a set of four ion engines for deep space travel and conventional hydrazine
thrusters for short range manuevers.

## Look Ma! No wings

Wings? Where we're going we don't need _wings_.
There is no lifting body, because there is no atmosphere on the bodies we will
visit, and we aren't about to terminate our lovely deep space trip by diving down
in a one way trip down some thick soupy atmosphere.

## Why do we have an umbrella?

That's our radiator system.  The vacuum of space makes us a thermos bottle that
is continuously heating itself. The only way to cool off is to radiate out in
the infrared with those giant radiator fins. Without it all the heat that our
reactor, instruments and our own bodies continuously generate can't escape our
ship. Our ship will melt from its own heat.

### Why does it have those stripes?

Forty years ago, someone at LEGO decided those would be cool colors to put on a
spaceship, so here we are.

## Which way is up?

There is no UP, since we are in a zero/micro-gravity environment. At best, if we
decide to touch a rather large asteroid, a faint tug of gravity will give us a
faint sensation of up and down. 

This model can be played with in any orientation, just as the astronauts in deep
space will float around their ship in any orientation.

## Who squashed our soccer balls?

Those are, believe it or not, our asteroid exploration robots. They are designed
to hop around in the ultra-low gravity of an asteroid. They can (and do) land
back in any orientation and keep working just the same. Remember, there's no up
or down.
