# Build notes

## Canopy attachment
We have to have the canopy a little "high" other wise it
interferes with the adjacent wedge plates and can't be opened.

## Wedge plates 
The single hinge design (473ff38) might not be sturdy enough
for play. 
1. Look into if we have enough hinges for a 2 hinge
per panel design.
2. Use the 10497 angle technique to secure the 45deg plate

Ideally we'd like to be able to latch the wedge plates so 
they don't swing out during play, but can be opened.
